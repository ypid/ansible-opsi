# Opsi product updates [[[
# --------------------
#
# Opsi products are usually installed/updated thought a central repository.
# This repository can hold a variety of Opsi products which can be updated (and
# installed if not already present) using the :program:`opsi-product-updater`.

#
# This section allows you to manually install provided Opsi products on the
# server.
#
# Refer to the :ref:`documentation of all options <opsi__ref_products>` for
# more details.

# Opsi product installation files [[[
#
# .. _opsi__section_installfiles:
#
# Opsi product installation files
# -------------------------------
#
# Some Opsi products are not usable out of the box.
# This section describes how to make those Opsi products usable by providing
# missing installation files.
# The reason why they are not usable is because of the restrictive nature of
# proprietary software (e. g. Microsoft).
#
# Refer to the :ref:`documentation of all options <opsi__ref_installfiles>` for
# more details.

opsi__installfiles_host: {}


# .. envvar:: opsi__installfiles_achrive_hash_algo_preference
#
# List of hash algorithms, in order of preference starting with the
# preferred one.
# The first hash algorithm will be used when it was specified using
# :any:`archive_checksum <opsi__ref_archive_checksum>`.
#
# Currently, only ``sha1`` is supported but the role default
# will use the strongest hash function available in the Ansible ``copy``
# module. The ``stat`` module could be used to use stronger hash function right
# now (as of Ansible 2.0) but the ``copy`` module calculates a checksum anyway
# so it was decided to wait for proper support in the ``copy`` module.
# Checksum calculation and compararchiven should be backwards compatible.
opsi__installfiles_achrive_hash_algo_preference: [ 'sha1' ]
